##  **Developmental Psychology PhD Student at UNC**

I am a graduate student working in the [Sheridan](https://circlelab.unc.edu/) and [Propper](https://beelab.web.unc.edu/) Labs at UNC. Broadly, I am interested in how experiences enriched in violence impact the development of neural and behavioral systems to increase psychopathology risk. Specifically, I study neural and behavioral systems that support fear and extinction learning, reactivity, and emotion regulation. I am also interested in how these systems are influenced by the microbiome. 

To explore my questions I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including MRI and fMRI, EDA, RSA, parent-reported questionnaires, microbial gene sequences, behavioral assessments of the child, parent-child interactions, statistical modeling, and machine learning. 

I also collaborate with other scientists and help them answer their research questions on topics such as maternal health, prenatal stress, health outcomes, sleep, executive function, reward, systemic inflammation, structural inequality, and more. 
    
I am currently *leading* the following projects:

**Early Adversity**

1. **Developmental mechanisms linking deprivation and threat to psychopathology and school outcomes.** Deprivation and threat are two dimensions of early adversity that uniquely contribute to behavioral and neural development. Using data from the Durham Child Health and Development Study (DCHD), I am exploring how  deprivation and threat impact psychopathology and school achievement through differences in cognitive control and emotional reactivity. 

    **Collaborators:** Cathi Propper (UNC), Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Daniel Bauer (UNC).
      
2. **Measuring unpredictability in the family and physical environment.** Unpredictability, or random fluctuations in the family and physical environment, might be a unique dimension of early adversity. We are using data-driven techniques (i.e., exploratory factor analysis) to explore how various measures of unpredictable and chaotic environments (e.g., household chaos, food insecurity, parental instability) relate to each other. 

    **Collaborators:** Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Katie McLaughlin (Harvard University).

3. **Threat exposure and infant behavior and physiology.** We are looking at how exposure to threat impacts infant behavioral and physiological reactivit, and affiliative behavior during the Still Paradigm. We are also looking at whether these effects interact with infant age, as animal work suggests that exposure to threat does not modify attachment strategies early in puphood.

   **Collaborators:** Cathi Propper (UNC), Margaret Sheridan (UNC).
    
**Microbiome**

1. **Microbiome, brain, and behavior.** Studying how the microbiome relates to the brain opens the door for important nutritional interventions for psychiatric disorders to be developed. We are exploring associations between the microbiome and brain structures involved in the salience network and fear learning (i.e., amygdala, insula, hippocampus, acc) in neonates. Additionally, we are looking at how the features of the microbiome that are to be associated with these neural structures are associated with behavioral reactivity later in development. 

    **Collaborators:** Cathi Propper (UNC), Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Rebecca Knickmeyer (MSU), Robert Quinn (MSU).

2. **Early experiences and the microbiome.** We know from animal models that cause variations in maternal care that the environment impacts the offspring's microbiome and gastrointestinal health. Taking into account this, and other work, we are exploring how variations in maternal care, in the form of sensitivity and harshness-intrusiveness, and experiences of violence, impact the child's microbiome.
