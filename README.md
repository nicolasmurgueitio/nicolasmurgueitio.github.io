## About Me

I am a PhD candidate with a focus on Child Psychology and Translational Neuroscience working at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research investigates translational mechanisms of transdiagnostic risk. Specifically, I study how  threat exposure (ie, violence) shapes the development of learning, memory, and emotional processing systems. Moreover, I study interactions between these neural circuits and peripheral systems (ie, autonomic nervous system and gut microbiome) supporting allostatic processes. 

I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including task-based fMRI and structural MRI, physiology (ie, HRV, EDA), questionnaires, genetic sequencing, psychiatric assessments and interviews, behavioral observations, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

Additionally, I collaborate with scientists across disciplines to explore other topics such as the environmental and neural correlates of cognitive and socioemotional development and psychiatric risk. 

## Ongoing Projects

### Physiological systems underlying social modulation of aversive learning after threat exposure

We are using a novel caregiver-stranger learning paradigm to explore how threat exposure impacts the development of aversive learning and the social modulation of aversive learning in young children. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan, Regina Sullivan). [OSF Pre-registration.](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/GPJCH)

### Neural processing of caregiver cues in children with developmental threat exposure

This project explores how exposure to threat impacts neural processing of caregiver cues using fMRI in a sample of young children with exposure to adversity. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan, Regina Sullivan). [OSF Pre-registration.](https://osf.io/m5d2g)

### Autonomic nervous system and neural correlates of emotional reactivity

Extensive research shows that individual differences in autonomic nervous system function increase or decrease risk for aberrant behavioral development. This multimodal study explores associations between ANS functioning at rest and children's neural responses to negative stimuli using fMRI. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan, Katie Mclaughlin). [OSF Pre-registration.](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/S7M9K)

### Neural correlates of cognitive reappraisal in early childhood
We are using a novel guided cognitive reappraisal fMRI task to investigate the neural correlates of voluntary emotion regulation strategies in early childhood. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Michelle Shipkova [co-first author], Margaret Sheridan, Kristen Lindquist). [OSF Pre-registration.](https://osf.io/k98pj)

### Infant gut microbiome and interoceptive circuitry
This project probes associations between the infant gut microbiome and resting-state functional connectivity of regions associated with interoceptive processing. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Cathi Propper, Sarah Short, Rasmus Birn, Rebecca Knickmeyer). 

### Preschool threat exposure and neural circuits underlying emotional reactivity
Leveraging longitudinal data spanning starting in the preschool years, we are exploring how preschool exposure to threat shapes neural responses to negative stimuli in adolescents and young adults. This manuscript is a registered report and currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan).
