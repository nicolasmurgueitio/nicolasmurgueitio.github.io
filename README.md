I am a graduate student working at the [Sheridan](https://circlelab.unc.edu/) and [Propper](https://beelab.web.unc.edu/) Labs. I am from Ecuador, and eventhough it is a country full of resources, it has a **big** opportunity gap (see Ecuador increasing [poverty](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/ECU/ecuador/poverty-rate) and [violence](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/ECU/ecuador/murder-homicide-rate) rates). My academic interests come from living in a country where children across socioeconomic strata are exposed to different experiences that puts them at risk of a variety of negative life outcomes. 

My research broadly explores: 

1) **Emotional learning circuits that are preserved across species, such as fear neurocircuitry, and parental modulation of fear learning.** These neural circuits have a great translational capacity, both from animal models to basic human research, and from basic to clinical human research. Focusing on these emotional learning circuits can help us understand the effects of trauma, and the role of parents, in the development of psychiatric disorders. 

2) **How dimensions of adversity differentially impact brain and behavioral development.** Studying the impact of dimensions of adversity on neural development has the capacity to ellucidate novel pathways that can be targetted through learning interventions, such as cognitive training and cognitive reappraisal. 

3) **The role of the gut microbiome on emotional neural development.** I believe that least *part* of the inequalities that we see in health and achievement are due to food insecurity and malnutrition. The gut microbiome brings to light innovative ways to intervene in children's emotional health through human nutrition, using pre and probiotics. 

To explore these questions I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including behavioral assesments, MRI and fMRI, EDA and RSA, parent-reported questionnaires, microbial gene sequences, machine learning, and other advanced statistical techniques. 

My research heavily focuses on the Dimensional Model of Adversity and Psychopathology (DMAP), you can read more about it here:

3. How to measure deprivation and threat: [Berman et al (2022)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/measuring-early-life-adversity-a-dimensional-approach/C7C005748EFA5E6C1DF1503E1D2A51B0)

I am currently leading the following projects:

1. **Behavioral adaptations to early adversity: A 7-year longitudinal study.** I am exploring how deprivation and threat predict psychopathology and academic achievement through emotional learning and cognitive abilites. I am also looking at whether poverty predicts experiences of deprivation and threat, and whether attachment security can buffer the effects of threat on emotional learning. For this project, I am using data from the Durham Child Health and Development Study (DCHD), a longitudinal project following children from 3-months to their school years in North Carolina. **Collaborators/Mentors:** Cathi Propper, Margaret Sheridan.

2. **Exploring unpredictability as a dimension of early adversity.** I am using data-driven approaches, exploratory factor and network analyses, to explore how various measures and observations of fluctuations in children's environments cluster and related with each other. For this project, I am working with data from the Wellness Health and Life Experiences Study (WHALE, PI: Margaret Sheridan). **Collaborators/Mentors:** Margaret Sheridan, Lucy Lurie.

3. **Do deprivation and threat differentially predict amygdala-vmPFC connectivity? A meta-analytic review.** I am currently reviewing the existing literature on early adversity and fear circuitry (ie, amygdala-vmPFC connectivity), in order to explore whether threat and deprivation differentially predict it.  **Collaborators/Mentors:** Margaret Sheridan, Meredith Gruhn, Esmeralda Navarro, Amy Carolus.

4. **The role of the gut microbiome on emotional learning neural structure and function during infancy.** Using machine learning approaches I am looking at the predictive capacity of the gut microbiome on emotional learning neural structure and function during infancy. I am using data from the Brain and Early Experiences Study (BEE, PI: Cathi Propper). **Collaborators/Mentors:** Cathi Propper, Margaret Sheridan, Rebecca Knickmeyer (MSU), Sarah Short (UW Madison).

Aside from working on my own research projects I also TA for undergraduate courses in child development, mentor undergraduate and postbacc research assistants, collect neuroimaging data with toddlers, coordinate biosamples, manage large/multidimensional data sets, and collaborate with other scientists in their own research projects.
