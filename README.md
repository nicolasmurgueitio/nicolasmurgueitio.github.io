I am a graduate student with a focus on Developmental Neuroscience working in the Sheridan and Propper Labs at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I study the immediate and enduring consequences of childhood trauma, with a focus on emotional reactivity and aversive learning. I am also interested in how peripheral biological systems support emotional reactivity, regulation, and brain development. This research program is heavily informed by rodent models of adversity rearing, specifically those focused on traumatic learning environments.

I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including task-based fMRI and structural MRI, physiology (ie, HRV, EDA), parent-reported and self-report questionnaires, genetic sequencing, psychiatric assessments, behavioral observations, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

I am currently leading the following projects:

- **Developmental mechanisms of deprivation and threat**: For my master's thesis I explored how deprivation and threat differentially increase risk for psychopathology and poor academic achievement through executive function and emotional reactivity. I utilized data from a longitudinal cohort study following mother-child dyads from 6 months to 7 years of age. This manuscript is currently under review. (Collaborators: Cathi Propper, Margaret Sheridan, Daniel Bauer)
- **Intimate-partner violence and anger bias**: This project explores how early exposure to intimate-partner violence impacts anger bias in early (6 years) and middle childhood (9 years), above experiences of cognitive deprivation and emotion socialization. We are also exploring whether these experiences differentially predict global emotion recognition at the same ages. This manuscript is currently under review. (Collaborators: Cathi Propper, Margaret Sheridan)
- **Childhood trauma and aversive learning**: We developed a novel learning paradigm to study how young children acquire aversive responses to caregivers and strangers, and we are studying how exposure to childhood threat impacts physiological (ie HRV, SCR) responses to this paradigm. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan, Regina Sullivan)
- **Neural processing of caregiver cues in threat-reared children**: We are exploring how exposure to threat impacts children's neural responses to caregivers during an fMRI paradigm. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan, Regina Sullivan)
- **Neural systems supporting cognitive reappraisal in early childhood**: We developed a novel fMRI paradigm to measure children's neural correlates of cognitive reappraisal and emotional reactivity. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Michelle Shipkova co-first author, Margaret Sheridan)
- **Gut microbiome and neural structure**: This project explores associations between the gut microbiome taxonomy and diversity, and neural structures involved in threat processing (ie, amygdala, insula, acc, thalamus) in neonates. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Michelle Graf co-first author, Margaret Sheridan, Rebecca Knickmeyer, Cathi Propper)
- **Autonomic nervous system and neural systems underlying emotion dysregulation in early childhood**: Using an fMRI paradigm, we are exploring how the autonomic nervous system at rest impacts the neural correlates underlying emotional reactivity and regulation in early childhood. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan)
