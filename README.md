I am a graduate student working at the [Sheridan](https://circlelab.unc.edu/) and [Propper](https://beelab.web.unc.edu/) Labs. My research broadly explores 1) how dimensions of adversity differentially impact brain and behavioral development, and 2) the role of the gut microbiome on emotional neurodevelopment. To explore these questions I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including behavioral assesments, MRI and fMRI, EDA and RSA, parent-reported questionnaires, microbial gene sequences, machine learning, and other advanced statistical techniques. I am particularly interested in studying emotional learnign circuits that are preserved across species, such as fear neurocircuitry. 

My research heavily focuses on the Dimensional Model of Adversity and Psychopathology (DMAP), you can read more about it here:

Currently, I am leading on the the following projects:
1. **Behavioral adaptations to early adversity: A 7-year longitudinal study.** Using data from the Durham Child Health and Development Study, I'm exploring how deprivation and threat differentially predict cognitive abilities and emotional learning during the first 7 years of life. I am also exploring whether deprivation and threat predict psychopathology and academic achievement. 
2. **Exploring unpredictability as a dimension of early adversity.** This study uses data from the Wellness Health And Life Experiences Study (WHALE) using a variety of instruments that measure unpredictability. We are using data-driven approaches to explore how these measures cluster and relate to each other, to create a robust composite of unpredictability. 
3. **Do deprivation and threat differentially predict amygdala-vmPFC connectivity? A meta-analytic review.** We are currently reviewing the current evidence on whether deprivation and threat differentially predict amygdala-vmPFC connectivity across the current literature. 
4. **The role of the gut microbiome on emotional learning neural structure and function during infancy.** Using data from the BEE Study, we are using machine learning to explore whether the gut microbiome has a good predictive capacity of neural structure and function related to emotional learning during infancy.
