I am a graduate student working in the [Sheridan](https://circlelab.unc.edu/) and [Propper](https://beelab.web.unc.edu/) Labs. Primarly, my research explores experience-expectant (e.g., caregiving), and experience-dependent (e.g., interpersonal violence) neural and behavioral development. Additionally, I  study the role of the gut microbiome on brain development. I am particularly interested in neural processes as they relate to basic emotional learning (e.g., fear learning, emotional reactivity), and more complex social processes (e.g., social skills). To explore my questions I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including fMRI, MRI, EDA, RSA, parent-reported questionnaires, microbial gene sequences, behavioral assesments, statistical modeling, and machine learning. 
    
I am currently *leading* the following projects:

1. **Behavioral adaptations to early adversity.** Cognitive deprivation and threat are two dimensions of adversity that uniquely contribute to behavioral and neural development. This approach is promising in not only understanding how adversity puts children at risk of negative outcomes, but also in informing learning-focused intervention strategies. Using data from the Durham Child Health and Development Study (DCHD), I am exploring how cognitive deprivation and threat uniquely contribute to the development of psychopathology and school achievement through differences in cognitive control and emotional reactivity.

2. **Neural correlates of attachment learning.** Attachment learning is the process by which children learn to approach and prefer parents and parent-related cues. However, the neural correlates of this process in humans still needs to be commpletely understood. Using a novel fMRI paradigm of emotion regulation, I am exploring how the brain activates to caregiver-cues.

3. **Emotion socialization, adversity, and socioemotional development.**. Early adversity is an important contributor to children's development. However, experiences of enrichment are also a powerful source of development. Socialization of emotions is a process by which children adquire knowledge about emotions (e.g., emotions are good or bad, etc). The main contributors of this process are parents. We are exploring how emotion socialization (i.e., parent beliefs about emotions) contribute to the development of socioemotional development such as emotion recognition, social skills, and anger bias above and beyond cognitive deprivation and threat.

4. **Dimensions of adversity and amygdala-mPFC connectivity? A meta-analytic review.** The control of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) over the amygdala has been studied extensively because of its importance in emotional processess such as fear extinction and emotion regulation. However, experiences of early adversity could affect how this important circuit behaves. We are eviewing the neuroimaging literature on amygdala-mPFC connectivity, we are exploring how different dimensions of adversity (e.g., cognitive deprivation, threat, mixed exposures) relate to it.

5. **Unpredictability as dimension of early adversity.** Unpredictability, or random fluctuations in the family and physical environment, might be a unique dimension of early adversity by which children learn the importance of cues in their environment. We are using a variety of data-driven techniques (e.g., exploratory factor analysis) to explore how various measures of this (e.g., household chaos, food insecurity, parental environment) cluster and behave with each other.

6. **Microbiome and emotional development.** Studying how the microbiome relates to brain and behavior opens the door for important nutritional interventions for psychiatric disorders to be developed. We are exploring associations between the gut microbiome and various indices of emotional development (i.e., brain structure, functional connectivity, observed behavior) as early as 2 weeks of age.

To read more about some of these projects please visit my [OSF profile](https://osf.io/profile/?view_only=02023f70035a49e6b56eb969a50ae3ea). I am also working to make my code accesible and reproducible using [GitHub](https://github.com/nicolasmurgueitio). 

Aside from working on my own research projects I also TA for undergraduate courses in child development, mentor undergraduate and postbacc research assistants, collect neuroimaging data with toddlers, manage large/multidimensional data sets, and collaborate with other scientists in their own research projects. Some of these projects explore issues such as prenatal stress, diet, sleep, structural inequality, reward learning, executive function, emotion regulation, physical brain, and mother's cognition.
