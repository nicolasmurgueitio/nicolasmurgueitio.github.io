I am a graduate student working in the [Sheridan](https://circlelab.unc.edu/) and [Propper](https://beelab.web.unc.edu/) Labs. Primarily, my research explores experience-expectant (e.g., caregiving), and experience-dependent (e.g., interpersonal violence) neural and behavioral development. Additionally, I  study the role of the gut microbiome on brain development. I am particularly interested in neural processes as they relate to basic emotional learning (e.g., fear learning, emotional reactivity), and more complex social processes (e.g., social skills). To explore my questions I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including fMRI, MRI, EDA, RSA, parent-reported questionnaires, microbial gene sequences, behavioral assessments, statistical modeling, and machine learning. 
    
I am currently *leading* the following projects:

1. **Dimensions of early adversity and behavioral development: A 7-year longitudinal study.** Cognitive deprivation and threat are two dimensions of adversity that uniquely contribute to behavioral and neural development. This approach is promising in not only understanding how adversity puts children at risk of negative outcomes but also in informing learning interventions. Using data from the Durham Child Health and Development Study (DCHD), I am exploring how cognitive deprivation and threat uniquely contribute to the development of psychopathology and school achievement through differences in cognitive control and emotional reactivity.

2. **Neural correlates of attachment learning.** Attachment learning is the process by which children learn to approach and prefer parents and parent-related cues. However, the neural correlates of this process in humans still need to be completely understood. Using a novel fMRI paradigm of emotion regulation, I am exploring how the brain activates to caregiver cues.

3. **Socio affective pathways linking early adversity and emotion socialization to psychopathopathology.**. Early adversity is an important contributor to children's development. However, strategies used by parents to socialize emotional experiences are also a powerful source of development. Socialization of emotions is a process by which children acquire knowledge about emotions (e.g., emotions are good or bad, etc). The main contributors of this process are parents. We are exploring how early adversity and emotion socialization (i.e., parent beliefs about emotions) contribute to socioemotional development.

4. **Dimensions of early adversity and amygdala-mPFC connectivity? A meta-analytic review.** The control of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) over the amygdala has been studied extensively because of its importance in emotional processes such as fear extinction and automatic emotion regulation. However, experiences of early adversity could affect how this important circuit behaves. We are reviewing the neuroimaging literature on amygdala-mPFC connectivity, and exploring how different dimensions of adversity (e.g., cognitive deprivation, threat, mixed exposures) relate to it. 

    **Collaborators:** Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Meredith Gruhn (UNC), Esmeralda Navarro (UNC), Amy Carolus (UNC), Kristen Lindquist (UNC).

5. **Unpredictability as a dimension of early adversity.** Unpredictability, or random fluctuations in the family and physical environment, might be a unique dimension of early adversity by which children learn the importance of cues in their environment. We are using a variety of data-driven techniques (e.g., exploratory factor analysis) to explore how various measures of unpredictable and chaotic environments (e.g., household chaos, food insecurity, instability) cluster and behave with each other.

6. **Microbiome and emotional development.** Studying how the microbiome relates to the brain and behavior opens the door for important nutritional interventions for psychiatric disorders to be developed. We are exploring associations between the gut microbiome and various indices of emotional development (i.e., brain structure, functional connectivity, observed behavior) as early as 2 weeks of age.

To read more about some of these projects please visit my [OSF profile](https://osf.io/profile/?view_only=02023f70035a49e6b56eb969a50ae3ea). I am also working to make my code accesible and reproducible using [GitHub](https://github.com/nicolasmurgueitio). 

Aside from working on my own research projects I also TA for undergraduate courses in child development, mentor undergraduate and postbacc research assistants, collect neuroimaging data with toddlers, manage large/multidimensional data sets, and collaborate with other scientists in their own research projects. Some of these projects explore issues such as prenatal stress, diet, sleep, structural inequality, reward learning, executive function, emotion regulation, physical brain, and mother's cognition.
