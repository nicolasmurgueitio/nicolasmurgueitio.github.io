##  **Affective-Social Neuroscience, PhD Student @ UNC Chapel Hill**

I am a graduate student working in the [Sheridan](https://circlelab.unc.edu/) and [Propper](https://beelab.web.unc.edu/) Labs. Primarly, my research explores experience-expectant (e.g., caregiving), and experience-dependent (e.g., interpersonal violence) neural and behavioral development. Additionally, I  study the role of the gut microbiome on neural development. I am particularly interested in neural processes as they relate to basic emotional learning (e.g., fear learning), and more complex social processes. To explore my questions and hypotheses I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including fMRI, MRI, EDA, RSA, parent-reported questionnaires, microbial gene sequences, behavioral assesments, machine learning, and other advanced statistical techniques. 
    
I am currently *leading* the following projects:

1. **Behavioral adaptations to early adversity** I am exploring how cognitive deprivation and threat predict psychopathology and educational outcomes through cognitive control and emotional reactivity.

    **Collaborators/Mentors:** Cathi Propper (UNC), Margaret Sheridan (UNC).

2. **Neural correlates of attachment learning.** I am using fMRI to explore how children's brains react to caregiver vs. non-caregiver scaffolds during a novel emotion regulation paradigm. Additionally, I am exploring how changes in caregiver impact these neural processess. 

    **Collaborators/Mentors**: Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Regina Sullivan (NYU), Kathryn Garrisi (UNC), Katie McLaughlin (Harvard University).

3. **Do deprivation and threat differentially predict amygdala-mPFC connectivity? A meta-analytic review.** I am currently reviewing the fMRI literature on early adversity and amygdala-mPFC connectivity across resting-state and task-based studies. 

    **Collaborators/Mentors:** Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Meredith Gruhn (UNC), Esmeralda Navarro (UNC), Amy Carolus (UNC), Kristen Lindquist (UNC).

4. **The role of the gut microbiome on neuro-affectitve development.**  I am looking at the predictive capacity of the gut microbiome on neuro-affectitve development across infancy. These include outcomes such as neural structures that support neuro-affective development (e.g., amygdala, insula), functional connectivity between these structures, and behaviors (i.e., behavioral reactivity and self-regulation). [Here](https://github.com/nicolasmurgueitio/RandomForestBrainMicrobiome) is code I am currently working on for this project.

    **Collaborators/Mentors:** Cathi Propper (UNC), Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Rebecca Knickmeyer (MSU), Sarah Short (UW Madison), Robert Quinn (MSU), Martin     Styner (UNC), Rasmus Birn (UW Madison).

To read more about some of these projects please visit my [OSF profile](https://osf.io/profile/?view_only=02023f70035a49e6b56eb969a50ae3ea). I am also working to make my code accesible and reproducible using [GitHub](https://github.com/nicolasmurgueitio). 

Aside from working on my own research projects I also TA for undergraduate courses in child development, mentor undergraduate and postbacc research assistants, collect neuroimaging data with toddlers, coordinate biosample storage and analyses, manage large/multidimensional data sets, and collaborate with other scientists in their own research projects. Some of these projects explore issues such as prenatal stress, diet, sleep, structural inequality, reward learning, executive functioning, and emotion regulation.
