I am a graduate student working in the [Sheridan](https://circlelab.unc.edu/) and [Propper](https://beelab.web.unc.edu/) Labs. My research has three main themes: 1) Exploring how childhood adversity, particularly threat, impacts the development of emotional learning and memory systems, and their underlying neurobiology; 2) The neural correlates of childrenâ€™s processing and preference of parents and parental-related cues and information; and 3) The role of the gut microbiome on neuro-affective development. To explore my questions I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including fMRI, MRI, EDA, RSA, parent-reported questionnaires, microbial gene sequences, behavioral assessments, statistical modeling, and machine learning. 
    
I am currently *leading* the following projects:

1. **Dimensions of early adversity and behavioral development: A 7-year longitudinal study.** Cognitive deprivation and threat are two dimensions of adversity that uniquely contribute to behavioral and neural development. This approach is promising in not only understanding how adversity puts children at risk of negative outcomes but also in informing learning interventions. Using data from the Durham Child Health and Development Study (DCHD), I am exploring how cognitive deprivation and threat uniquely contribute to the development of psychopathology and school achievement through differences in cognitive control and negative reactivity.

2. **Neural correlates of attachment learning.** Attachment learning is the process by which children learn to approach and prefer parents and parent-related cues. However, the neural correlates of this process in humans still need to be completely understood. Using a novel fMRI paradigm of emotion regulation, where parents scaffold their children, I am exploring how the brain activates to caregiver vs. non-caregiver audiovisual stimuli.

3. **Socio affective pathways linking early adversity and emotion socialization to psychopathopathology.**. Early adversity is an important contributor to children's development. However, strategies used by parents to socialize emotional experiences are also a powerful source of information in development. Socialization of emotions is a process by which children acquire knowledge about emotions (e.g., emotions are good or bad, etc). The main contributors to this process are parents. We are exploring how early adversity and emotion socialization (i.e., parent beliefs about emotions) contribute to socio affective development.

4. **Dimensions of early adversity and amygdala-mPFC connectivity: A meta-analytic review.** The control of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) over the amygdala has been studied extensively because of its importance in emotional processes such as fear extinction and automatic emotion regulation. However, experiences of early adversity  affect how this important circuit behaves leading to deficits in these behavioral and mental processes. We are reviewing the neuroimaging literature on amygdala-mPFC connectivity, and exploring how different dimensions of adversity (e.g., deprivation, threat, mixed exposures) relate to it.

5. **Unpredictability as a dimension of early adversity.** Unpredictability, or random fluctuations in the family and physical environment, might be a unique dimension of adversity by which children learn the importance of cues in their environment. We are using a variety of data-driven techniques (e.g., exploratory factor analysis) to explore how various measures of unpredictable and chaotic environments (e.g., household chaos, food insecurity, instability) cluster and behave with each other.

6. **Unpredictable and fragmented parental signals in early childhood.** A growing body of research is focused on measuring unpredictability within the observed parent-child interactions. This method is based on pre-clinical work with rodents, specifically the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) model. We are replicating previous work in infants on how the unpredictability of parental signals impacts behavioral regulation in early childhood.

8. **Microbiome and brain development.** Studying how the microbiome relates to the brain opens the door for important nutritional interventions for psychiatric disorders to be developed. We are exploring associations between the gut microbiome and brain structures that support socioemotional processes (i.e., amygdala, insula, hippocampus) in neonates. 

    **Collaborators:** Cathi Propper (UNC), Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Rebecca Knickmeyer (MSU), Sarah Short (UW Madison), Robert Quinn (MSU), Martin Styner (UNC). 

9. **Early experiences and the microbiome.** We know from animal models that cause variations in maternal care that the environment impacts how the offspring's microbiome and gastrointestinal system develop. Taking into account this, and other work, we are exploring how variations in maternal care in the form of sensitivity and harshness-intrusiveness impact the subsequent gut microbiome early in life.

To read more about some of these projects please visit my [OSF profile](https://osf.io/profile/?view_only=02023f70035a49e6b56eb969a50ae3ea). I am also working to make my code accessible and reproducible using [GitHub](https://github.com/nicolasmurgueitio). 

Aside from working on my own research projects I also TA for undergraduate courses in child development, mentor undergraduate and postbacc research assistants, collect neuroimaging data with toddlers, manage large/multidimensional data sets, and collaborate with other scientists in their own research projects. Some of these projects explore issues such as prenatal stress, diet, sleep, structural inequality, reward learning, executive function, health outcomes, and mother's cognition.
