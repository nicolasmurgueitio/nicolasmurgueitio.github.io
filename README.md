## ABOUT ME

I am a PhD candidate with a focus on Child Psychology and Translational Neuroscience working at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research investigates multi-developmental pathways involved in the development of emotional and behavioral disorders, particularly in children. I utilize various tools from developmental neuroscience, psychophysiology, and child development such as task-based fMRI and structural MRI, heart-rate variability, electrodermal activity, genetic sequencing, psychiatric assessments and interviews, behavioral observations, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

## RESEARCH THEMES

### IMMEDIATE AND ENDURING CONSEQUENCES OF THREAT EXPOSURE

Adverse childhood experiences are prevalent and account for a large proportion of mental health disorders across the lifespan. Understanding learning and developmental mechanisms could inform novel therapeutics to support adversity-exposed populations. My work explores how experiences of threat (ie, domestic violence, abuse) impact the development of various neural, physiological, and behavioral systems that confer risk for emotional disorders. To inform paradigms and hypotheses I rely on rodent models of abusive rearing and social adversity. In this line of work I have explored developmental mechanisms such as emotional reactivity, emotion perception, learning, memory, and sensory processing. Moreover, I explore these questions acrosss the lifespan, particularly during early childhood and adolescence/emerging adulthood. 

## MULTI-BODY-BRAIN INTERACTIONS      

A key, and overlooked, function of the brain is to coordinate and regulate vital bodily functions such as heart beat, respiration, thermal regulation, digestion, etc. Exploring complex body-brain interactions across the lifespan could inform therapeutic efforts targeting bodily systems to improve cognitive and emotional health. In this line of work I study how various markers of brain function and structure interact with bodily systems including the autonomic and endocrine systems, and the microbiome during infancy and childhood.
