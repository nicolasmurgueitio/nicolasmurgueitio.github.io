I am a graduate student with a focus on Developmental Neuroscience working in the [Sheridan](https://circlelab.unc.edu/) and [Propper](https://beelab.web.unc.edu/) Labs at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Broadly, I study the immediate and enduring consequeneces of childhood trauma, with a focus on emotional reactivity and aversive learning. I am also interested in how peripheral systems support emotional response and regulatory systems. 

I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including structural MRI and task-based fMRI, physiology (i.e., HRV, SCR), parent-reported questionnaires, genetic sequencing, psychiatric assessments, behavioral observations, statistical modeling, and machine learning. 
    
I am currently leading the following projects: 

**Developmental mechanisms of deprivation and threat.** For my masters thesis I explored how deprivation and threat differentially increase risk for psychopathology and poor academic achievement through executive function and emotional reactivity. I utilized data from a longitudinal cohort study following mother-child dyads from 6 months to 7 years of age. This manuscript is currently under review.

**Intimate-partner violence and anger bias.** This project explores how early exposure to intimate-partner violence impacts anger bias in early (6 years) and middle childhood (9 years), above experiences of cognitive deprivation and emotion socialization. We are also exploring whether these experience differentially predict global emotion recognition at the same ages. This manuscript is currently under review. 

**Childhood trauma and aversive learning.** We developed a novel learning paradigm to study how young children acquire aversive responses to caregivers and strangers, and we are studying how exposure to childhood threat impacts physiological (ie HRV, SCR) responses during this paradigm. This manuscript is currently in preparation.

**Neural processing of caregiver cues in threat reared children.** We are exploring how exposure to threat impacts children's neural responses to caregivers in an fMRI paradigm. This manuscript is currently in preparation.

**Neural systems supporting cognitive reappraisal in early childhood.** We developed a novel fMRI paradigm to measure children's neural under cognitive reappraisal and emotional reactivity. This manuscript is currently in preparation.

**Gut microbiome and neural structure**. This project explores associations between the gut microbiome and neural structures involved in threat processing (ie, amygdala, insula, acc, thalamus) in neonates. This manuscript is currently in preparation.

**Autonomic nervous sytem and neural systems underlying emotion dysregulation in early childhood.** Using an fMRI paradigm, we are exploring how the autonomic nervous system at rest impacts the neural correlates underlying emotional reactivity and regulation in early childhood. This manuscript is currently in preparation.
