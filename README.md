## About Me

I am a graduate student with a focus on Developmental Neuroscience working in the Sheridan and Propper Labs at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I study the immediate and enduring consequences of childhood trauma, with a focus on how children learn from, remember, forget, and respond to aversive experiences. I am also interested in how peripheral biological systems are associated with aversive neural responses and brain development. This research program is heavily informed by rodent models of adversity rearing, specifically those focused on traumatic learning environments.

I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including task-based fMRI and structural MRI, physiology (ie, HRV, EDA), parent-reported and self-report questionnaires, genetic sequencing, psychiatric assessments, behavioral observations, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

Additionally, I collaborate with scientists across disciplines to explore other questions such as how adolescents brains process social information and the role of prenatal experiences (ie stress, sleep, nutrition) on child brain development. 

## Projects

### Intimate-partner violence and anger bias

Children exposed to violence often show atypical social behaviors that might origin in how they process social and affective information. This project explores whether experiences of intimate-partner violence predict anger bias across early and middle childhood above experiences of deprivation and emotion socialization. This manuscript is currently under review. (Collaborators: Cathi Propper Margaret Sheridan).

### Threat exposure and aversive learning in early childhood

Rodent models of threat rearing show that these experiences drive an accelerated development of aversive learning in young offspring. This study explores associations between threat  exposure and physiological systems underlying aversive learning using a novel caregiver-stranger paradigm. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan, Regina Sullivan, Katie McLaughlin).

### Neural processing of caregiver cues in threat reared children

Research suggests that children exposed to childhood adversity show differences in how they process caregiver (ie faces) cues. However, animal models of threat rearing suggest that experiences of threat might drive these neurobiological effects. This study uses fMRI to explore how threat exposure impacts neural processing of caregiver (audio-visual) cues in early childhood. This manuscript is currently in preparation.(Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan, Regina Sullivan).

### Autonomic nervous system and neural correlates of emotional reactivity

Extensive research shows that individual autonomic nervous system functioning relate to behavioral developmenta and emotional response systems. The present study explores whether this association is in part explained by how children's brains respond to negative stimuli using fMRI. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan, Katie Mclaughlin).

### Gut microbiome and neural strucutre

The gut microbiome has been identified as a possible mechanism and biomarker of precursors of psychopathology, including how children process and respond to aversive stimuli. This project explores associations between the neonatal gut microbiome and structures of the brain involved in salience processing. (Collaborators: Michelle Graf co-first author, Margaret Sheridan, Rebecca Knickmeyer, Cathi Propper).
