## About Me

I am a graduate student with a focus on Developmental Neuroscience working in the Sheridan and Propper Labs at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I study the immediate and enduring consequences of childhood trauma, with a focus on how children learn from, remember, forget, and respond to aversive experiences. I am also interested in how peripheral biological systems are associated with aversive neural responses and brain development. This research program is heavily informed by rodent models of adversity rearing, specifically those focused on traumatic learning environments.

I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including task-based fMRI and structural MRI, physiology (ie, HRV, EDA), parent-reported and self-report questionnaires, genetic sequencing, psychiatric assessments, behavioral observations, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

## Projects

### Intimate-Partner Violence and Anger Bias

I am currently leading the following projects:
- **Intimate-partner violence and anger bias**: Children exposed to violence often show atypical social behaviors that might origin in how they process social and affective information. This project explores whether experiences of intimate-partner violence predict anger bias across early and middle childhood above experiences of deprivation and emotion socialization. This manuscript is currently under review.
- **Childhood trauma and aversive learning**: We developed a novel learning paradigm to study how young children acquire aversive responses to caregivers and strangers, and we are studying how exposure to childhood threat impacts physiological (ie HRV, SCR) responses to this paradigm. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan, Regina Sullivan, Katie McLaughlin)
- **Neural processing of caregiver cues in threat-reared children**: We are exploring how exposure to threat impacts children's neural responses to caregivers during an fMRI paradigm. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan, Regina Sullivan, Katie McLaughlin)
- **Neural systems supporting cognitive reappraisal in early childhood**: We developed a novel fMRI paradigm to measure children's neural correlates of cognitive reappraisal and emotional reactivity. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Michelle Shipkova co-first author, Margaret Sheridan)
- **Preschool threat exposure, emotional reactivity, and affective coloring**: We using data from a longitudinal study exploring the role of preschool threat exposure on the neural correlates of emotional reactivity and affective coloring. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan, William Copeland, Kimberly Carpenter)
- **Gut microbiome and neural structure**: This project explores associations between the gut microbiome taxonomy and diversity, and neural structures involved in threat processing (ie, amygdala, insula, acc, thalamus) in neonates. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Michelle Graf co-first author, Margaret Sheridan, Rebecca Knickmeyer, Cathi Propper)
- **Autonomic nervous system and neural systems underlying emotional reactivity in early childhood**: Using an fMRI paradigm, we are exploring how the autonomic nervous system at rest impacts the neural correlates underlying emotional reactivity in early childhood. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Margaret Sheridan, Katie Mclaughlin)
- **Threat and anger**: Prior research shows that threat exposure but not experiences of deprivation are linked with irritability in youth. This project explores whether anger  acts as a unique link between threat experiences and psychopathology across childhood, and whether it differs with other negative emotions such as fear. This manuscript is currently in preparation. (Collaborators: Cathi Propper, Margaret Sheridan)
