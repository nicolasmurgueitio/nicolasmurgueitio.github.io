I am a graduate student with a focus on Neuroimaging and Quantitative Methods working in the [Sheridan](https://circlelab.unc.edu/) and [Propper](https://beelab.web.unc.edu/) Labs at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Broadly, I am  interested in how exposure to  trauma increases risk for mental illness through neurobiological mechanisms that support threat processing. I am also interested in biomarkers of transdiagnostic mechanisms of psychopathology, such as the gut microbiome and systemic inflammation. 

I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including MRI and task-based fMRI, physiology, parent-reported questionnaires, genetic sequencing, psychiatric assessments, behavioral observations of the child and the parent-child interaction, statistical modeling, and machine learning. 

I also collaborate with other scientists and help them answer their research questions on topics such as maternal stress and nutrition, sleep, cognitive control, reward learning, structural inequality, and racism. 
    
I am currently focused on the following ideas: 

**Interpersonal trauma in infancy and early childhood.** Neuroscientific models of early adversity propose that separate dimensions of adversity predict psychopathology through differential neurobiological mechanisms. However, most of the empirical testing of these ideas has been conducted with adolescent samples. I am working to replicate these findings in samples of infants (<12 months), and longitudinally across early (5 years) and middle childhood (7 years). 

**Biomarkers of transdiagnostic mechanisms.** I am exploring associations between known transdiagnostic mechanisms of psychopathology (e.g., emotional reactivity) with biomarkers. For example, early gut microbiome has gained significant interest as it could inform novel strategies to prevent the development of mental illness. I am working to explore how the microbiome is associated with neural maturation and emotional response systems.
