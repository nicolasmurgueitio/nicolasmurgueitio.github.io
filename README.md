##  **Developmental and Child Psychology PhD Student at UNC**

I am a graduate student working in the [Sheridan](https://circlelab.unc.edu/) and [Propper](https://beelab.web.unc.edu/) Labs. Broadly, I am interested in how experiences enriched in violence impact the development of neural and behavioral systems. Specifically, I study neural and behavioral systems related to fear learning and memory, emotional reactivity, and emotion regulation. I am also interested in how these systems are influenced by the gut microbiome. 

To explore my questions I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including fMRI, MRI, EDA, RSA, parent-reported questionnaires, microbial gene sequences, behavioral assessments of the child, parent-child interactions, statistical modeling, and machine learning. 
    
I am currently *leading* the following projects:

**Early Adversity**

1. **Longitudinal mechanisms linking deprivation and threat to psychopathology and school outcomes.** Deprivation and threat are two dimensions of early adversity that uniquely contribute to behavioral and neural development. Using data from the Durham Child Health and Development Study (DCHD), I am exploring how  deprivation and threat uniquely contribute to the development of psychopathology and school achievement through differences in cognition and emotional reactivity. 

    **Collaborators:** Cathi Propper (UNC), Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Daniel Bauer (UNC).
      
2. **Measuring unpredictability in the family and physical environment.** Unpredictability, or random fluctuations in the family and physical environment, might be a unique dimension of adversity by which children learn the salience of cues in their environment. We are using data-driven techniques (e.g., exploratory factor analysis) to explore how various measures of unpredictable and chaotic environments (e.g., household chaos, food insecurity, parental instability) relate to each other. 

    **Collaborators:** Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Katie McLaughlin (Harvard University).
    
**Gut Microbiome**

1. **Gut microbiome, brain, and behavioral reactivity.** Studying how the microbiome relates to the brain opens the door for important nutritional interventions for psychiatric disorders to be developed. We are exploring associations between the gut microbiome and brain structures involved in the salience network and threat learning (i.e., amygdala, insula, hippocampus) in neonates. Additionally, we are looking at how the features of the microbiome that seem to be associated with these neural structures are associated with behavioral reactivity later in infancy. 

    **Collaborators:** Cathi Propper (UNC), Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Rebecca Knickmeyer (MSU), Robert Quinn (MSU).

2. **Early experiences and the gut microbiome.** We know from animal models that cause variations in maternal care that the environment impacts how the offspring's microbiome and gastrointestinal system develop. Taking into account this, and other work, we are exploring how variations in maternal care, warm sensitivity and harshness-intrusiveness, and experiences of violence, impact the child's gut microbiome.
