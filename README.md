I am a graduate student working at the [Sheridan](https://circlelab.unc.edu/) and [Propper](https://beelab.web.unc.edu/) Labs, my research broadly explores how dimensions of adversity differentially impact brain and behavioral development, and the role of the gut microbiome on emotional neurodevelopment.
