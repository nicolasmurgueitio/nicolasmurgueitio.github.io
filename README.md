I am a graduate student working at the [Sheridan](https://circlelab.unc.edu/) and [Propper](https://beelab.web.unc.edu/) Labs. Broadly, my research explores how early adversity impacts the brain and behaviors. I am particularly interested in emotional learning (e.g., fear learning, emotion regulation), and social (e.g., attachment learning) processess. 

To explore my questions and hypotheses I use a variety of methodologies and approaches including fMRI, MRI, EDA, RSA, parent-reported questionnaires, microbial gene sequences, behavioral assesmentes, machine learning, and other advanced statistical techniques. 
    
I am currently *leading* the following projects:

1. **Behavioral adaptations to early adversity: A 7-year longitudinal study.** I am exploring how cognitive deprivation and threat predict psychopathology and educational outcomes through emotional reactivity and cognitive control. I am also looking at whether socioeconomic disadvantage predicts experiences of cognitive deprivation and threat, and whether attachment security can moderate the effects of threat on emotional reactivity. 

    **Collaborators/Mentors:** Cathi Propper (UNC), Margaret Sheridan (UNC).

2. **Neural correlates of attachment learning.** I am using fMRI to explore how children's brains react to caregiver vs. non-caregiver scaffolds during a novel fMRI emotion regulation paradigm. Additionally, I am exploring how changes in caregiver impact these neural processess. 

    **Collaborators/Mentors**: Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Regina Sullivan (NYU), Kathryn Garrisi (UNC), Katie McLaughlin (Harvard University).

3. **Do deprivation and threat differentially predict amygdala-vmPFC connectivity? A meta-analytic review.** I am currently reviewing the fMRI literature on early adversity and amygdala-vmPFC connectivity across resting-state and task-based studies. This, in order to explore whether threat and cognitive deprivation, or mixed exposures (e.g., child maltreatment), differentially predict it.  

    **Collaborators/Mentors:** Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Meredith Gruhn (UNC), Esmeralda Navarro (UNC), Amy Carolus (UNC), Kristen Lindquist (UNC).

4. **The role of the gut microbiome on neuro-affectitve development infancy.** Using machine learning I am looking at the predictive capacity of the gut microbiome on neuro-affectitve deelopment during infancy. These include outcomes such as neural structures that support neuro-affective development (e.g., amygdala, insula), functional connectivity, and behaviors (e.g., behavioral reactivity, self-regulation). [Here](https://github.com/nicolasmurgueitio/RandomForestBrainMicrobiome) is code I am currently working on for this project.

    **Collaborators/Mentors:** Cathi Propper (UNC), Margaret Sheridan (UNC), Rebecca Knickmeyer (MSU), Sarah Short (UW Madison), Robert Quinn (MSU), Martin     Styner (UNC). 

To read more about some of these projects please visit my [OSF profile](https://osf.io/profile/?view_only=02023f70035a49e6b56eb969a50ae3ea). I am also working to make my code accesible and reproducible using [GitHub](https://github.com/nicolasmurgueitio). 

Aside from working on my own research projects I also TA for undergraduate courses in child development, mentor undergraduate and postbacc research assistants, collect neuroimaging data with toddlers, coordinate biosample storage and analyses, manage large/multidimensional data sets, and collaborate with other scientists in their own research projects. Some of these projects explore issues such as prenatal stress, diet, sleep, structural inequality, reward learning, executive functioning, and emotion regulation.
